Initial Ideas:

Create an app that helps patients manage their medications by providing reminders, tracking dosage, and alerting them to potential drug interactions. Include a feature for caregivers to monitor adherence.

Perhaps you gameify the app so your character levels up if you remenebr to take your meds
However with that you want to strike a balance between it being good to remmeber, but alap not too bad when you forget so the user doesn't feel too slighted

Maybe kids, for example my brother needs to take his allergy medication every morning
And basically every kid has a phone these days
The meds can be tracked and managed by a parent
Or you could target older people
Make their phone their medical reminder
Make it super accessible to that age group

It could also manage when you're going to run out
Prompt you to get a refill

Like you could track medication history

You can track conditions as something to easily show a healthcare provider if they can't access records easily
You can also have it track medical related things, like doctors appointments and other recurring events
You could transform it from just giving your med reminders, to being a comprehensive medical history
